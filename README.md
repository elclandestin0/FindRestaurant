# FindRestaurant
A Foursquare + Google Maps API mashup to find a restaurant's name, address and the image-url by inputting the restaurant niche name, and the coordinates of a city.

Simply clone/zip this file, open <code>findARestaurant.py</code> in your favourite text editor and compile it! Or, you can load up terminal, and execute <code>python findARestaurant.py</code>. Message me if you have further details. 

<strong> NOTE: The client_id for both the Maps API and Foursquare API is intended for my use only. If you are interested, you can request your own API keys from <a href="developer.google.com">Google</a> and <a href="developer.foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> </strong>
